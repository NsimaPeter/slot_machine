# Slot_machine
This is a simple text-based slot machine game implemented in Python. The game allows players to spin the virtual slot machine and see if they win based on the combination of symbols.

# How to Play
Run the Python script "run.py" in a Python environment.
You will be asked to press Enter to spin the slot machine.
The slot machine will randomly generate three symbols from the available options: Football, Bell, Lemon, Orange, Star, and Moon.
The result of the spin will be displayed on the console.
If all three symbols are the same, you win!
You will be asked if you want to play again. Enter 'y' to continue playing or any other key to exit the game.
